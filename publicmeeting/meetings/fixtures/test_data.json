It isn\u2019t just the borough\u2019s backyard; it\u2019s the best place to bike, jog, walk your dog and set your kids free \u2014 except for one factor. Cars are permitted to speed through its 3.35 mile loop drive. With that mix, Brooklyn\u2019s backyard is downright chaotic.\r\n\r\nThe Prospect Park Road Sharing Task Force was established to calm the chaos, and they\u2019ve come up with a succinct solution. The current configuration leaves bicyclists and pedestrians to share scraps of the road. The Task Force\u2019s new proposal will put people first.\r\n\r\nOn February 28th, the Task Force will present their recommendations to park users. At the meeting, T.A. will be standing up for a Prospect Park that prioritizes safe bicycling and walking (jogging, too). We need all Brooklynites who love the loop drive to join us.", "title": "Prospect Park Task Force", "created_datetime": "2012-02-29T10:13:27.240", "updated_datetime": "2012-02-29T10:13:27.291", "venue_additional": "More information at the TA website -- https://www.transalt.org/events/calendar/5724", "end_time": "2012-02-28T20:00:00", "begin_time": "2012-02-28T18:00:00", "venue_name": "Prospect Park Picnic House, Prospect Park, Brooklyn NY", "slug": "prospect-park-task-force"}}]
